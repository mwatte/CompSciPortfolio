            <p class="intro">My name is Maja Watte. I am a ninth grader attending Everest Public High School. My favorite subject is Science, and my favorite color is blue. I have a multitude of animals at my house; two cats, two dogs, four chickens, and some fish, to be specific. I live in Redwood City, and my favorite place to go (other than my house) is the library...or a candy store. </p>

                <p>My favorite foods are basically anything with sugar in them. I love strawberries because they're so soft and sweet, and on top of that they're even natural and good for you! I like cake because it's sweet as well. My top cake flavor would have to be vanilla. I love the simple flavor of it. And if you combine both strawberries and cake...Well, I have no words to describe my happiness with that. Strawberry cake would probably be the most delicious thing ever. Or at least, it would be in my opinion! Now, about the candy thing...I don't like nuts. Especially peanuts. Pistashios are okay, but I dislike all other nuts, especially in my candy. Blech! But anyway, I like reading comics, too. <a href="http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch01/ch01_01.html">Unsounded</a> is about  but I'm not going to tell you anything else about this comic, since you might want to read it for yourself. Click on the title of the comic to be taken to the first page. <a href="http://www.paranatural.net/index.php?id=1">Paranatural</a> is about this kid who just moved to a quirky town called Mayveiw, where he is assulted by weird people and weirder purple things his first day there.<a href= "http://www.sssscomic.com/comic.php?page=1">Stand Still Stay Silent</a>, or SSSS, is about a post-apocolyptic world after most of the people have fallen prey to a sickness. Click the title of the comic to read it! My favorite subject is science. Science is really, really cool. I mean, you get to learn how things work, and you get to learn about cells and atoms and computers and <em><strong>space</strong></em>, and I just find all of it really exciting! Except geology. Geology is boring. I also like english and art classes, since you get to make stuff up. I like using my imagination and creating things. It's very enjoyable to me.</p>

                <p>My pastimes are reading, sleeping, eating, watching anime, and making things, as well as listening to music and playing on my guitar. When I read, I mainly read fictional stories. You know, stories that have magic and futristic science stuff and things like that. I'm not entirely sure why I like fantasy so much. I guess I just think reality is boring or something. My favorite genres are fantasy, sci-fi, and dystopian. Some authors who I really like include J.K. Rowling, Erin Hunter, who is actually multiple people, James Patterson, and Rick Riordan. I like sleeping mainly because sleeping is nice. When I wake up after getting just the right amount of sleep, it's really refreshing and I love that feeling. I list eating as a pastime because I have a bad habit of eating when I'm bored or when I have nothing to do. And if I can find anything sweet. I also like making things. See, what I mean by that is that I like using my hands to create something. It's really rewarding when I manage to make something that was in my head come into reality. Although mainly it's pretty hard for me to bring drawings out like that, which is why I want to get better at it. When making things, I sew, write, type, draw, paint, weave, or use whatever craft my creation requires to be brought forth. As you might see already, when I write I tend to be pretty wordy, and to ramble, and I have no clue why. Just part of who I am I guess. When I'm not doing any of the above activites, and maybe even during, I'm usually listeing to music. "But what kind of music do you listen to Maja?" I listen to music sung by VOCALOIDs. VOCALOIDs are basically computer generated voices singing songs, most of which are in Japanese, as the VOCALOIDS were first created in Japan. Some of the songs would be completely impossible to sing with our own vocal chords, but they sound very cool when sung by the VOCALOIDs. There are a few specific VOCALOIDs that I listen to, such as Hatsune Miku, GUMI, Kagemine Len and Rin, and IA. I started getting into VOCALOIDs after I drifted in that direction from listening to songs from anime on YouTube. Anime are essentially animated manga, which are Japanese comics. Just like with drawing comics here, there are many different styles of manga, which can be used for a multitude of different things. Oh, and by the way, pretty much all of the music I listen to is in Japanese.:3 I first started watching anime when I was really little, since my dad watched a lot of anime and I would watch with him. You know, it's kind of weird. If I hadn't started watching anime, I never would have watched a particular anime, Fullmetal Alchemist. And if I had never watched that anime, and if I never liked it, then I never would have decided that I wanted to make the metal arms that they use a reality, and I would still not know what I wanted to do as a career. Pretty strange, huh? Anyway, other than that, I have taken up playing guitar, and it is <em>awesome!</em> I started with the acoustic my dad has, and that was pretty fun. Then my mom mentioned getting an electric guitar, and I thought it would be best to wait and make sure that I would stay with guitar playing, but after she mentioned it I started getting obsessed, and so I got my very first electric guitar a few months after I started playing, and that was the <em>best</em> idea. It totally rocks! (pun intended)</p>

                <p>As you might be able to see, my goals aren't really all that special. Get a house, raise a family, that sort of thing. But there are two goals that not all people would put on their goal list: Become a biomedical engineer, and work on robotic prosthetics. You see, the two are related. To be able to work on robot limbs and such, I would have to become a biomedical engineer. And to be a biomedical engineer, I would have to go to college. Getting a house would be nice too, especially if I could pay for all of it and have it become all mine. I don't really want to live in an apartment for too long when I'm no longer living on my own, especially if I'm going to raise a family. I also want a garden and lots of cats, so an apartment might not be the best option for me to live long-term. And then there's the matter of rent. So, I would just really like having a house ofer an apartment. I want to get married and have kids because there aren't enough weird people like me out in the world! We need more geeks and nerds that aren't afraid of showing their geeky or nerdiness! Also, people are too touchy about girl vs. boy, and people who are different in attraction, gender identification, religion, and a whole bunch of other stuff. I want to do my best, with my genes and my method of raising children, to make my kids better than all those people who feel everyone has to fit in a mold. I want them to be able to tolerate as many people as possible. It might be hard, but I'll do my best. But anyways, science! It's freaking awesome!</p>

            <p>I want to do a whole bunch of things, only a few of which are listed here. The thing is, I don't know how to do them yet. I want to learn how to code, although one might say I already know how, as I'm coding right now. I can already draw manga, but I don't draw as well as I'd like to. So, I put that here on this list too. Maybe I'll add a page which has all the manga drawings I'm most proud of, so you all can take a look and see. I'll consider it. I can also sew, well enough to make a doll or a peice of clothing, but I'm still an ameteur. Sigh. Now, most of those have been related to creating something, so you might have been a little surprised when you saw the thing about dual wielding katanas. Well, I've wanted to be able to use swords for as long as I can remember after I started watching anime and getting into mideval stuff. Though, specifically wanting to use the katana is pretty recent. And by recent, I mean in the past five or six years. Tehe.</p>
