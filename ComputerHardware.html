          <h1>Computer Hardware</h1>
          <p>Hello again! In this section of my website, I will do my best to explain to you the different components of the computer and how they all connect and communicate. Now, this page has quite a bit of text in it, so I'll keep this short. Happy reading!</p>
          <h3>Motherboard</h3>
          <div class="container">
            <div class="red">                  
            <p>The motherboard is where every separate peice of the computer is connected.  The motherboard of a computer could be called the backbone of the PC and possibly even be considered the most important peice of the computer. There are some limitations to what a motherboard can do, though. Certain motherboards can only support specific types of components, so either you would need to find a different component type than the one you originally wanted, in order for it to fit your motherboard, or you would have to get a motherboard that fits the component, and that is very inconvenient. Sometimes, the motherboard includes the functions of the sound and video cards, which is very useful for keeping computers such as laptops and tablets small. In a desktop computer, the motherboard is mounted opposite the most easily accessed side of the casing. On the front, it has ports for all of the internal components to connect to, as well as peripheral card slots, which are where most video, sound, and other expansion cards are connected. On the left, there are ports to connect the external things, such as the moniter, mouse, and keyboard. The motherboard connects to power through a specifically designed port.</p>

          <h3>CPU</h3>   
          <div class="container">
            <div class="green" >
            <p>The CPU is the part of the computer responsible for interpreting commands and carrying them out. In other words, it is a lot like the brain of the computer. It are also known as the Central Processing Unit. Some of them have pins on the back of them. For those that do, one should be very careful when handling them, as those pins are easily bent. Each motherboard only supports a particular range of component types, as I said before. That applies to CPUs as well, so you should check to make sure that they are compatible before you buy either one. A modern CPU tends to be small and square with short metallic connectors on the back. It attaches directly to the motherboard through a special CPU socket or slot. A small lever is used to help secure it. CPUs tend to get very hot when they're working, even if it was only for a short while, and that makes it necessary to include a heat sink and a fan, which are attached directly on the CPU. These often come with the CPU when you buy it.</p>

          <h3>RAM</h3> 
          <div class="container">
            <div class="purple">
            <p>RAM stands for Random Access Memory. Having more RAM lets the computer work with more information at a time, which can greatly increase its performance. RAM is often referred to just as 'memory,' even though there could be other types of memory in the computer. Again, you should check to make sure if your particular kind of RAM is compatible with the motherboard before you buy it. Often, the RAM comes as a stick which looks a bit like a short ruler with black squares or rectangles on the top. On the bottom, there is often a few notches to help guide proper installation. It is installed in the memory module slots, which are identified by the small hinges on either side, used to lock it in place. Particular slots may be required for different sizes, so you should check that before you install or buy.</p>

          <h3>Hard Drive</h3>
          <div class="container">
            <div class="green">
            <p>Hard Disk Drive, or a hard drive, is the main storage area in a computer. Most files, operating systems, and software titles are stored here, which makes it important to back up often. If your hard drive crashes, and you don't have it backed up, you just lost almost everything you used on your computer. One of them is usually the size of a paperback book, while the sides have holes in them to make it easy to mount. It is mounted so all the connections are facing the inside of the computer. The back end of the hard drive is the side that has the port for the cable that would connect it to the motherboard. The type of cable used varies depending on the hard drive used, and almost always come with the hard drive in the purchase. The back also contains a connection for power. Most hard drives include jumper settings that tell the motherboard to recognize it when there are more than one of them.</p>

          <h3>Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse</h3> 
          <div class="container">
            <div class="red">  
            <p>The monitor, keyboard, and mouse of a computer are what we usually see the most. While we don't really see the motherboard or hard drive, these three devices are what we tend to think of when we think of a computer. The monitor, keyboard, and mouse are what make computers so easily used, and some people stay glued to them for their entire lives. The monitor shows you what is happening through the video card, and it enables us to see what we are doing, whether that be coding or video games. The keyboard allows us to change what we see on the screen pretty easily, once we get the hang of it, and it is a very important instrument for most everyone who uses a computer. The mouse is what lets us choose what will happen or what we are going to change, again with ease. It isn't the end of the world if the mouse stops working, though, because often your keyboard is capable of selecting things as well, although sometimes in a much more roundabout way. In laptops, all three are built in, but for a desktop computer, these are separate items.</p>

          <h3>How Do These All Communicate?</h3>
          <div class="container">
            <div class="purple">
              <p>The way that all of the different parts of the computer communicate with each other is by the motherboard. They send electrical signals to each other through the wires that connect them to the motherboard and to the motherboard itself, where the signals are interpreted, connected, and sent where they should go. While the CPU can process a lot of things very quickly, the motherboard is what actually lets the necessary signals get through to it in a way that it can understand. The motherboard is what actually gets all the parts to work together, and gets the computer to do what it is supposed to. The wires are often made of copper, as copper is a very good conducter of electricity, and those wires are what are used to connect things in a way that they can function together.</p>
