            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>As the name of this page implies, this page will be all about the different projects I have made. At the time of making this, the only projects I have finished are the website itself and a calculator, which I shall post a link to down below. By the end of the school year, however, I will have finished many more projects, so this page will be filled up much more. I guess this is kind of placeholder text or something.</p>
            <h2><a href="index(Drop).html">Calculator</a></h2>
            <div class="red"><p>This is a calculator which I made in class with a partner, although to be honest, I did most of the work. We started with some framework that our teacher gave us, and it had the function for addition already there. So, what I did was I copied those basic funtion lines and changed them to suit the other five operations. Now, the first three were easy, since I only had to change the operation sign, but the fifth operation, powers, I found hard. I knew I needed a loop, but I didn't really know what to put in the loop. Luckily, my teacher helped out there. Percentages were easier, luckily, as it only requires simple multiplication. And at the end of the day, I made a fully functioning calculator! Yay!</p></div>
            <h2><a href="TextBasedGame.html">TextBasedGame</a></h2>
            <div class="green"><p>Here is a text based adventure game which I created with a couple of other people. I feel like I did most of the work though. In this game, you die a lot, but I think where I wrote stuff, I did a pretty good job. Yay! The story can be very different depending on the path that you take, but all of it has some sort of unreal quality. None of the stories in the game would be possible in our world without magic. Also, the game is very unforgiving when it comes to spelling, so try your best to copy what choices you are provided with letter for letter. Even if they are spelled wrong. Happy gaming!</p></div>
            <h2><a href="guitarString.html">Guitar String Simulator</a></h2>
            <div class="purple"><p>This is a little thing that I made in the fourth and fifth weeks of the Computer Science Expeditions class. It is, as the name suggests, a simulation of guitar strings. While the strings don't move, you <em>are</em> able to make different sounds. The bars running vertically do not do much other than specify where the sliders should go to make different sounds on the strings. The strings are what you click to make sounds, and they make their standard sounds when you click them while the sliders are to the left of the page. Also, if you click and drag off of the slider, or click and drag on the "strings", then the code doesn't really know what to do with that, so try not to do so that much. Thanks!</p></div>
            <h2>Vindinium</h2>
            <div class="blue"><p>Vindinium is an AI creation challenge in which people make AIs to try to win against other AIs. This is included in my projects page because I created an AI for Vindinium as a project in this class, and so it qualifies. There will be more on this topic on the Vindinium page, to which you can find a link in the nav bar.</p></div>
